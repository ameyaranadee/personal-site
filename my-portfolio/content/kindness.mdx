I think everyone who’s ever lost someone has, at least at one point in their life, wished that they could have been kinder. Kinder to the person who passed, kinder to the moments they shared. You wish you were kind enough when it mattered. And you wish your words and your actions stood testimony to that. But I guess you are kind. It’s just the moments that are unfair. They mask all the good that you try to do. In every choice you make, there is a choice that looses. 

The difficult thing to do perhaps is to be kind in the moment. Nobody really teaches you how to be kind. And I feel it’s such a wrongly defined word too. Do you know what kindness is? I feel most people think about kindness as this transaction between two people on different scales of the society. But I don’t agree. I don't think I can really count the times I've been kind. I wish we had a tally for all the kind choices we've made so far. Would have been warm on a bad day. I'm sitting here trying to recollect and nothing comes to my mind. As if I’m searching for evidence to tell myself that I’m kind enough. And kind when it matters. Why can I count the regrets then? I wish I knew. Perhaps regrets are just a memory of moments like any other, with all the good parts kind of peeled off.

Slowly with time, I feel you realize that kindness is not a virtue. Nor is it a quality. It has nothing to do with character. Kindness, I’ve come to realize, is simply a choice like any other, a decision in the moment, regardless of recognition. Does that make any sense to you? I don’t like to think of life as a zero sum game. What goes around doesn’t always have to come around. Because in doing so we inadvertently admit the cruelty within us. In doing so, we don’t give each other a chance to be kind. To ourselves. To each other. And to the moments that we share.
