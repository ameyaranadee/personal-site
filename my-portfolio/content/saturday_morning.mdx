Have you found yourself getting lost in someone’s account on instagram and feel like even though you don’t know that person you actually do? Isn’t it funny? If I run into that person on a random Saturday morning, it’ll be very likely that all we have to say to each other is a simple hi. Yet somehow when you see them, you think about whether the person really is the one in the pictures? Am I the only one in relationships with instagram accounts? Or is it us all? Or can we actually spend a Saturday morning together? In a cafe somewhere? Or on a bench in the park? Even if it’s gloomy outside, would you have coffee with them? If you really are the average of the five people you spend the most time with can I count these accounts in it too? 

I’ve found myself getting lost in someone’s instagram account to the point where I feel like I know that person when I in reality, I really don’t. I find myself smiling at their captions as if I’m in the pictures. Isn’t it funny? If I run into that person on a random Saturday morning, chances are all I’d manage to say is a simple hi :) And walk past them. Is it just me? Or could we actually spend a Saturday morning together? Maybe in a cozy cafe somewhere? Or on a bench in the park? Even if it’s almost freezing and depressingly gloomy, will I get out of my bed to have coffee with them?  If I really am the average of the five people I spend the most time with can I count some instagram accounts too?
