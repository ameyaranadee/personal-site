I went to our spot today. The pond’s still there but the water felt closer this time, almost as if it wanted to reach out and touch me. It even has tiny little waves dancing on the surface. The birds are chirping so loudly, I can’t hear the music in my ears. I feel a strong desire, a pull in my chest. A yearning that’s so strange yet so familiar. It weakens my heart, my chest pains. But only slightly. It’s not too cold out here. I’m standing under our tree. I don’t want to sit here without you. Or without you reading my palm. Holding it ever so softly with your fingers. I never thought I could feel that light. Like a feather. The tree is still here, its leaves whispering softly with the wind. I look at the clouds. It feels like they are slipping away from me. So I call for them. To stay. I want this moment to stay. Still. I don’t want to capture it, I just want to be in it. This moment feels like a hug. I’m mustering the courage to sit. I’m doing it as I write. I sit down. It’s getting dark out here. The clouds are gone. Birds are still chirping in the distance. But I don’t mind. I could sit here for hours looking at this barren land in front of me.

I want to lie down but like that day, I feel a small fear in me. As if somebody might walk in from behind and ruin this moment for me. I look back to check. But there’s no one. I’m still paranoid, a dull ache in my chest. It feels heavier now, like a stone. It’s getting colder as well, I’m shivering. It sucks that I can’t stay in this place forever. That I can’t look at the water and wonder where it came from. Or where it is going. 

This feeling is unusual, this place even more. The wind is growing stronger. My hands are getting cold and I can’t type anymore. But this feeling even though unusual, seems familiar. I sit in this place alone, calm and quiet. While this place continues to be and continues to change. I have absolutely no hold over it but somehow commands something deep within me. I feel powerless but I’m okay with it. I can see a few stars now. They seem to smile at me, so I smile back. I smile like I always do, it’s my curtain. Nothing to see behind. Or beyond. So I smile and slowly, I start to forget. 

I start to walk away but before I do, I stop. I close my eyes and let the moment sink in one last time. Like a whispered secret between me and this spot. I know I’ll come back one day. I know I’ll come back to this fleeting stillness. And when I do, I hope the stars will be right here, waiting for me.
