When I visit mumbai, I wander through the streets like a romantic, the only city I can truly call mine. But I feel a strong ache in my chest as I do. It’s old yet beautiful, every nook and corner, every cracked wall and every pothole carries a story untold. I’ve captured so many of these places in pictures, tucked away in google accounts I rarely open anymore. The irony isn’t lost on me, I know.

I think back to those days, when I felt lighter and freer, or atleast that’s how I remember them now. Back then I roamed this city as if it belonged to me, as if the city and I were the best of friends, as if we shared an inside joke. Maybe we did. I’d scroll through instagram pages, let strangers decide my weekend plans. I’d wander aimlessly through lanes unfamiliar, faces even more. I’d sit at the beach with the sand in my feet, or sometimes at marines with my feet hanging with the vast ocean beneath. I’d let the air calm my restless mind. 

The dates were sweeter, the places warmer, and the streets felt strangely familiar. Some evenings I’d walk through these streets, drunk on freedom and cheap booze, laughing with my friends. Other nights, I’d be sitting across my parents in modest restaurants. But every visit was an escape. In those fleeting moments, I’d forget about what waited for me. It didn’t matter where I’ve come from. Or where I’m going. The loneliness I carried around with me, would disappear in silence.This endless city, a beautiful blend of noise and calm. I’d lose myself in it all, imagining a life where I truly belonged here. A tiny flat at the edge of the city, living in the quaint lanes of the city, making a life for myself. 

Only to return to the same suffocating walls, to the same spiraling thoughts, to the weight of my own chaos. I would lose myself in the monotony of my own making. It wasn’t sustainable, this day to day living without an anchor. I wish I had paused. Just for a moment or two. To take a deep breath or maybe two. To pause and acknowledge everything that I had built amidst this chaos. A life that was messy, but beautiful and raw in its own stupid little way. 

I don’t live that life anymore. Those days of wandering are behind me, I’m only a visitor now. But the memories, they remain waiting patiently for me. They surface whenever I return to those same old spots. I can remember myself when I was here, parts of me lost in the corners of the city. 

The last time I wrote about mumbai, I asked myself, if this city, the one I’ll leave someday, will it ever leave me? And today, I know the answer. That no, it won’t. It never will. This city, my city will always be my home. I carry it with me everywhere I go. Perhaps that’s the beauty of it, this constant achenes, the feeling of belonging despite not really belonging. So when I walk these streets again, I don’t need to search for what I left behind. I think I’ve made my peace with it. It still welcomes me, maybe with the whispers of a different promise, not of freedom but of something else. I will walk through these streets with a quiet smile, letting my ache grow into something softer.
