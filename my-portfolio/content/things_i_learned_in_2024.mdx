Things I learned this year

- Kindness more than anything is just a choice
- It can be difficult to unlearn traits that have stuck with you growing up; take your time
- Life is fragile and short, every year is a reminder
- I spent the last 3 months of this year unable to walk without pain but the only thing that got me through was the feeling of belonging; find your community
- Everything is a matter of perspective; let the world surprise you
- Workout in the morning; walk in the evening
- Community provides comfort; service gives meaning
- The goal is not to meditate for 15 minutes but to stay meditative through the day
- Don’t compare yourself to others; just because you’re 2 steps behind 
- Avicii stays generational
