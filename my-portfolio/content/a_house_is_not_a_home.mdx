These words that I’m writing now have been bouncing around in my head for days. Maybe weeks. Perhaps even months. I can never tell. They’ve taken the shape of so many different emotions; longings I can’t quite define.

When I was really small and chubby, there were nights I couldn’t fall asleep. Baba used to carry me around the living room, chanting Atharva Shirsha. He says, I’d drift off on his shoulder in a jiffy. I guess he misses the times when my face fit in the crook of his neck, and how my entireenter body eased into his embrace.

My childhood feels like a distant memory now, sort of like a dream I was once a part of. I’m not sure how much I can trust myself when it comes to matters of the past, but I choose to believe the stories they tell me. Even my parents may not remember everything but I guess they are my best bet, they are the rightful keepers of my story. 

I think I’m starting to understand why they keep repeating the same stories about me. Why baba keeps saying that I used to be his Undir mama, or why my mother keeps reminding him that I was actually her Waghoba. I think they keep repeating the same stories not just for me, but for themselves too. To hold on to my dream for as long as they can.

I wonder sometimes if my childhood is slipping through my fingers. Adulting has such a tight grip on me now, that I can’t shake it off. I can’t escape. I’m trapped in this cage I’ve built for myself, this cage of expectation. My own constant lofty desire to fulfill this intellectual expectations I have of myself. This constant desire to be someone. To do something. To do everything all at once. And yet, the more I try to hold on to this dream of mine, the more it slips away. 

I guess their stories help me stay connected. As though building a bridge between who I once was, and who I’ve now become. Maybe that’s why it all keeps coming back to me—when baba’s ever so loud voice goes soft with nostalgia, or when my mother’s laughter travels oceans and continents to reach my heart and make it dance. Maybe, that’s when some parts of me surrender to this reminder that no matter how much I change, there will always be parts of me that are still theirs.

Isn’t it strange? How people who knew us before we knew ourselves hold onto fragments of us we can’t recall. I may not remember falling asleep on baba’s shoulders, but somehow whenever I close my eyes to try and remember, I see his white jhabba as he paces in the living room, and my tiny little head on his shoulder.

These seemingly small moments form a small piece of this enormous puzzle that is my life. And yet, without them, this puzzle will always remain incomplete. Maybe that’s why even though time moves forward, I still circle back to my childhood. Maybe its always there, weaving its way through my days, even now.

Maybe this is what it means to grow up? To hold onto and carry these tiny, forgotten pieces of your puzzle, as you keep trying to find new ones to fit alongside them. Somehow I find this thought comforting. Whispers from a time when the world felt smaller still tug at me with invisible strings. 

They remind me that even if I don’t have all the answers right now, even if I haven’t yet become the person I imagine myself to be, I’ve always been someone they held onto. Even if I couldn’t see it then. Maybe in this silence, in this quite space between me and the universe, even though the details are blurry and I can’t really remember whether those stories are true, I learn that long before I learned to chase my dreams, I was a part of theirs.
