sound of the waves

sunlight on the ocean makes the surface look like a satin cloth

i close my eyes and imagine how you’d look in a satin dress

and i smile slyly and feel silly

that even in the middle of nowhere you have all my attention

there’s something surreal about being surrounded by nothingness

your senses are heightened 

you can smell the salt in the sea

you can feel the wind in your face

you can see the rocks 

and the tiny fishes

lost in the vast expanse of the ocean

just like me and you

lost in this world

belonging to nothing 

trying to find meaning

you hold on to the railing

as the ride becomes violent

and the waves get stronger

that’s when you know who’s in control

it was never you

the ocean is too powerful 

the rocks are immovable 

it was never you

it will never be you

so there’s a moment of fear

my heartbeat races and panic surrounds

i close my eyes again
 to see if the image of you in a satin dress

can calm me down

but i see nothing this time

when suddenly a shining beam of light falls on my face

and i open my eyes 

only slightly

to see a lighthouse

and suddenly feel safe
